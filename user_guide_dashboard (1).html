    <h1>User Guide: Interactive Thesis Dashboard</h1>
    <p>This dashboard is designed to support the thesis on Kansei Engineering and Social Media-Based Stocktaking for reusable plastic bottles. It consists of four interactive modules that visualize emotional clustering, demand forecasting, product design feedback, and social media sentiment analysis.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Kansei Emotion Cluster Viewer</h2>
        <p><strongPurpose:</strong> Visualize emotional profiles based on Kansei words.</p>
        <p><strongHow to Use:</strong> Select a Kansei word from the dropdown. The radar chart will update to show how that emotion scores across five dimensions: Softness, Sustainability, Innovation, Trust, and Design.</p>
        <p><strongSupports Thesis:</strong> Helps identify emotional clusters that influence product perception.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Demand Forecast Chart</h2>
        <p><strongPurpose:</strong> Compare actual and forecasted demand over 12 months.</p>
        <p><strongHow to Use:</strong> View the line chart showing two datasets: Actual Demand and Forecasted Demand. This helps visualize trends and prediction accuracy.</p>
        <p><strongSupports Thesis:</strong> Demonstrates the effectiveness of time series forecasting (e.g., XGBoost) in stocktaking.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Product Design Feedback</h2>
        <p><strongPurpose:</strong> Provide design suggestions based on selected emotions.</p>
        <p><strongHow to Use:</strong> Choose an emotion from the dropdown. The feedback box will display recommended design features (e.g., color, shape, texture).</p>
        <p><strongSupports Thesis:</strong> Links emotional preferences to actionable product design strategies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Social Media Sentiment Explorer</h2>
        <p><strongPurpose:</strong> Analyze sentiment and keyword trends from social media hashtags.</p>
        <p><strongHow to Use:</strong> Select a hashtag from the dropdown. The bar chart shows sentiment distribution (Positive, Neutral, Negative), and the word cloud displays frequently used terms.</p>
        <p><strongSupports Thesis:</strong> Validates consumer sentiment and trends using social media data.</p>
    </section>
